h1. What should dia.js be?

A simple, elegant diagram editor implemented in Javascript, using the HTML5
 canvas tag or SVG (I haven't made up my mind yet..).

Why call it dia.js? I came across Gnome's Dia project one day, and it's
 simplicity and usability baffled me. I want to make my javascript version just
 as baffling. (I'm not making an exact replica -- Dia just inspired me.)

h2. Key points

# Keyboard shortcuts
# Toolbar / modes to the left just like in dia (and other software..)
# Diagram-type-specific toolbar below it -- e.g. choose between Flowchart / UML
# Plugins possible -- for example a plugin to support logic gate emulation
   similar to (but simpler than) HADES
